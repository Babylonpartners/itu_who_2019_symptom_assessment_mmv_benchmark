# FGAI4H TG Symptom â€“ MMVB backend

*This repository hosts the backend only. Find the frontend*
*[in this repository](https://github.com/FG-AI4H-TG-Symptom/fgai4h-tg-symptom-benchmarking-frontend)*
*and follow the instructions there.*

## Installation Instructions

The following instructions have been tested on a macOS, if you are using another development environment the instructions
might be a little bit different.

It will be assumed you have installed and use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started), but you can install
uncontainerized local versions of the dependencies too.

### Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment with Python 3.7+.
Python 3.8.1 is recommended; you can use pyenv to manage your Python installations.
```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

And make sure to update your python path for the next steps
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:./mmvb_backend
```

### Requirements:

This section assumes the use of the pyenv.
The requirements for running the server locally can be installed by
```
$ make install_requirements
```

To install test requirements, which includes tools for development, run
```
$ make install_test_requirements
```

### Pre-commit hooks

This repository lints and tests code as a part of the CI process.
[Pre-commit][pre-commit] is a project that you can use to run a suite of tools to check the codebase.

To install the hooks that we use run:
```
make precommit_install
```

### Helper make commands:

This assumes you have activated your local virtual environment.
To run local linting and codestyle checks you can use
```
make lint
```
We use this in our CI process to make sure codestyle is being adhered to.

### Install and Configure MySQL

#### Docker

Although MySQL will be running in a container you need a local MySQL connector. On macOS you can install it with
```
brew install mysql-connector-c
```
and add it to your PATH (source `~/.zshrc` or re-open your terminal after this step)
```
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/mysql-client/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Now, get the image and start up a container
```
docker pull mysql
docker run -p 3306:3306 --name fgai4h-tg-symptom-mmvb-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='{your-password-here}' -d mysql
```

Then connect to MySQL using the root user (supply the password you specified above):
```
docker exec -it fgai4h-tg-symptom-mmvb-mysql mysql -u root -p
```

You should now see a `mysql>` prompt and can continue with **Set up MySQL database** below.

#### Local install
As an initial step you might need to run the following for being able to start MySQL services in the next steps:
```
$ xcode-select --install
```

These steps assume you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
To install MySQL:
```
$ brew install mysql
$ brew install mysql-client
$ brew tap homebrew/services
$ brew services start mysql
```

Make sure to change `host` from `127.0.0.1` to `localhost` in `mmvb_backend/settings.py` in the `DATABASES` config.

Configure a new password for the root user:
```
$ mysqladmin -u root password '{your-password-here}'
```

Then connect to MySQL using the root user:
```
$ mysql -u root -p
```
and provide the password you configured when prompted.

You should now see a `mysql>` prompt and can continue with **Set up MySQL database** below.

#### Set up MySQL database

In the client console, create a system user with proper privileges and a new database to be used on the django project:
```
mysql> CREATE USER 'system'@'172.17.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'systemsecret';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'system'@'172.17.0.1';
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mmvb;
mysql> quit
```
*Replace `127.0.0.1` with `localhost` if you are using a local MySQL installation (rather than via Docker)*


### Install project requirements

Install the Python MySQL client module with OpenSSL (the link path is specific to macOS/Homebrew):
```
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib pip install mysqlclient
```

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Celery setup
For using Celery (task queue) we will need to setup a message broker. Redis should be a good option.
You should be able to download the proper docker image and run it with the following commands:

```
$ docker pull redis
$ docker run -p 6379:6379 --name fgai4h-tg-symptom-mmvb-redis -d redis
```

On a dedicated shell, run the Celery worker server:

```
celery -A mmvb_backend worker -l info
```

#### Apply database schema

```
python manage.py migrate
```

### Create a superuser for admin website

This step will be useful for the future if/when we start using the admin interface from django. This will be the user with all admin privileges you will have to access that interface.
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
then provide an `username`, `email` and `password` (with confirmation).


## Run the application

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The application api will be running on [http://localhost:8000/api/v1/](http://localhost:8000/api/v1/)

To check the admin interface, go to [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)

There is an experimental auto-generated documentation on [http://localhost:8000/api/docs/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)


#### General Tips ####

It is always useful to run `python manage.py migrate` after you checked out code from someone, as the data models/schema might
have changed and you need to persist them.

If/when you implement a new data model, you need to run:
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

to generate the schema changes and apply them to the database.


If you need to implement new celery tasks for any of your Django installed apps (the ones listed under `INSTALLED_APPS` in the project `settings.py` module) you only need to:

  - Create (if not already created) a `tasks.py` module under the desired Django app directory (`cases` for example)
  - Follow the template shown below on your `tasks.py`:
  ```
  from celery import shared_tasks

  @shared_tasks
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y
  ```

Then you could simply import the `add` task somewhere in your code and run it and, if the celery worker server is up and running, your task would be executed.

For more details check the [celery docs](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html).
